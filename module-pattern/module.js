/**
 * -- JavaScript modules --

 * code independent of other components. 
 * This provides loose coupling to support well-structured code.
 * The module pattern allows for public and private (plus the lesser-know protected and privileged) access levels.
 * Modules should be Immediately-Invoked-Function-Expressions (IIFE) to allow for private scopes.
